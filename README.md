# csvtojson

- In this API we take an excel file as an input.
- Will Collect all the details of the customer by passing the customer Id.
- Will get the request body which is prepated internally by the API.
- Finally it will be written/saved in an excel sheet. 

#Note
- Currently it's taking input of customer number. May be in future need to develop an end point such that based on the unique profiles/Customer Id's it will generate request body and will save that in Sheet.
